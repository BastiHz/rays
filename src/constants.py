# Note about FOV and appearance of the walls:
# The aspect ratio of the walls depends on the fov, the aspect ratio of the
# window, and the value of h in this line: line_height = h / wall_distance.
# They look square when the fov is 66Â°, the aspect ratio is 4:3 and h is
# the display height. Consider this when changing any one of those three values.
